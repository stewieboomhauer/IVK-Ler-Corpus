# Study 1.2.
After defining 20 most reliable and informative features, I use them in Study 1.1. to look at all students at once. I also look at two different factors, namely learners L1 language and learnersâ€™ gender in order to answer the question how language proficiency differs in learners depending on these factors. 
Before exploring the data, a few steps had to be taken for preprocessing. First, I eliminated the data from the students who took part in less than a half collection periods. In the end, only data from students who wrote more than 6 stories out of 12 were used. These were the 9 students who had been in the classroom for the entire duration of the experiment, i.e., a year and a half. The rest, whose data was excluded, left the class in the summer of 2020. Then, I deleted story five because first, only five people wrote it, and second, they were all females. Also, in order to find out what effect a L1 language factor has on the comprehensiveness of the texts of different students, it was necessary to combine all European languages together, namely Bulgarian, Italian, and Greek. In this way it is possible to compare students whose first language is Arabic with students whose first language is one of the European languages. After these steps I first analyzed data without looking at the factors. Then I looked closer at factors gender (f vs. m) and language (ar vs. eu).
