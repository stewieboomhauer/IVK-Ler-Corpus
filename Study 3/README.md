# Study 3

To address the fourth research question, how much the computation of complexity features is affected by the influence that learner language characteristics have on the automated NLP analyses, I investigate the impact of the differences between automatic CTAP analyses of original texts (original hypothesis) and corrected texts (target hypothesis). 

Referring to the result of the study 3.2. in Weiss & Meurers (2021), I do not expect an extreme difference in complexity features on corrected learner data (target hypothesis) and original learner data (original hypothesis).
According to Weiss & Meurers (2021), accuracy is meaningless when comparing the difference between continuous variables, thus I computed the z-scores of the complexity features before calculating the root mean squared difference (RMSD) between the features computed for original learner data and the features computed for corrected learner data. RMSD is a commonly used measure of the differences between continuous variables predicted by a model or estimator and observed values. The RMSD represents the square root of the second sample moment of the differences between predicted values and observed values, or the root mean square of these differences. The RMSD metric provides a concise summary of the difference in standard deviations between the features produced using the two types of hypotheses (original vs. target), with large differences having a greater impact than many minor ones.
